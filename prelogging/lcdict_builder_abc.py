    A class for automating multi-package / multi-module logging configuration.
    ``LCDictBuilderABC`` is an abstract base class: its metaclass is ``ABCMeta``,
    defined in ``_collections_abc.py`` of the standard library. You can't
    directly instantiate this class: it has an `abstractmethod`
    ``add_to_lcdict(lcd: LCDict)``. Every package or module that
    wants a say in the configuration of logging should define its own
    (sub*)subclass of ``LCDictBuilderABC`` implementing ``add_to_lcdict``.

    Once (and once only), the application should call the classmethod
    ``LCDictBuilderABC.build_lcdict(...)``, which returns an ``LCDict``.
    The parameters of ``build_lcdict`` are the same as those of ``LCDict.__init__``.
    The ``build_lcdict`` method does the following:

        * creates a new ``LCDict``, ``lcd``, with the parameters provided;
        * calls ``subcls.add_to_lcdict(lcd)`` on every (imported!) subclass
          ``subcls`` that implements ``add_to_lcdict``, in a breadth-first way;
        * returns ``lcd``, the logging config dict built by the previous
          steps.

    Your program should then call ``config()`` on the returned logging config
    dict.

    For example, given the following inheritance tree (where "<" means
    "is a superclass of"):

    .. code::

        LCDictBuilderABC < MainBuilder < BuilderModuleA
                                       < BuilderModuleB
                                       < BuilderPackage < BuilderSubPackage

    Assuming that all classes shown implement ``add_to_lcdict``, that method
    will be called first on ``MainBuilder``; then on
    ``BuilderModuleA``, ``BuilderModuleB``, and
    ``BuilderPackage``, in some order; then on ``BuilderSubPackage``.

    See the test ``test_lcdict_builder.py`` and the example ``example_lcdict_builder.py``
    for multi-module examples of these capabilities.
