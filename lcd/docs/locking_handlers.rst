Locking  Handlers
===============================

The multiprocessing-safe handler classes ``'LockingStreamHandler'``, ``'LockingFileHandler'``
and ``'LockingRotatingFileHandler'`` reside in ``locking_handlers.py``.
The :ref:`LCDEx` class and its methods provide an interface to them â€”
in the ordinary course of things it's probably unnecessary to use them directly.
