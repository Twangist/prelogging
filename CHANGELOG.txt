0.4.3
--------
* Removed 'class_' keyword parameter from add_formatter, no longer
  add this to dict:
  * it's not used by dictConfig, and
  * it's inserted even when creating a custom formatter
    (it's harmless but confusing)

* Added method add_custom_formatter(...)
    [ TODO: to LCDictBasic? LCDict? ]

* Added example custom_formatter.py

  Described in Guide to Examples chapter    [ TODO ]
