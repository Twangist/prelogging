0.4.3rc1
--------

* Removed 'class_'/'class' keyword parameter from LCDictBasic.add_formatter,
  it's no longer added to formatter sub-sub-dicts:

  * it's not used by dictConfig, and
  * it was inserted even when creating a custom formatter
  * it's (perhaps harmless but) misleading: that's not how a custom formatter
    is specified

  Docs and tests updated accordingly.

* Added examples custom_class_formatter.py, custom_callable_formatter.py,
  and brief descriptions in Guide To Examples
