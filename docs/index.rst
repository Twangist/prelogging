Documentation for `prelogging` (ver |version|)
==================================================

`prelogging` is a pure Python package that simplifies
configuration of `logging`, makes more advanced `logging` features easily accessible,
and includes several "batteries":

    * a basic fund of formatters
    * simplified creation of handlers
    * multiprocessing-safe handlers which output to the console, to files and to rotating files.
