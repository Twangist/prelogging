`prelogging` v\ |release|
==================================================

`prelogging` is a pure Python package that provides a simple, consistent, powerful
API for configuring logging. The package includes several "batteries":

    * consistent methods to add handlers both mundane and exotic
    * multiprocessing-safe handlers which output to the console, to files and
      rotating files, and to the system log
    * formatter presets â€” a fund of useful shorthands for formatters, which you can extend and modify
