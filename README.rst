README for `prelogging` |release|
=================================

See the full documentation at `https://pythonhosted.org/prelogging/ <https://pythonhosted.org/prelogging/>`_.

.. What it is, who it's for, why it is, what it does, why it's cool.

`prelogging` streamlines the process of *configuring* logging in Python, as provided by the
`logging <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html?highlight=logging#module-logging>`_
package in the Python standard library. It presents a straightforward, consistent API for
specifying how you want logging set up — the format of messages, their destinations
and loglevels (severity thresholds), and so on. While `prelogging` aims at clarity
and simplicity, it in no way prevents you from using any of `logging`'s features.
It's intended for experts and novices alike.

A program *logs messages* in order
to record its successive states, and to report any anomalies, unexpected situations
or errors, together with enough context to aid understanding and diagnosis. Messages
can be logged to multiple destinations at once — ``stderr`` in a terminal, a local file,
the system log, email, or a Unix log server over TCP, to cite common choices.
Logging is a very sophisticated version of using the `print` statement for debugging.

Once you've configured logging, use it is easy and powerful. Configuration, then,
is the barrier to entry.

`prelogging` attempts to help you set up logging to give the results you hope for: messages
appearing in the formats you want, where you want, when you want (that is, at what times,
or under what conditions). `prelogging` makes some of the more advanced capabilities
of `logging` easily accessible. It even supplies missing functionality: it provides
multiprocessing-safe logging to the console, files, rotating files, and `syslog`.

When logging is correctly set up to your liking, the benefits can be great. When
you or a colleague examines a log file, you can more quickly find the information
you seek, because each message was written to the place you expect (just once!),
under just the circumstances you intended, and in the format you're looking for.

Getting configuration right, however, can be tricky. Infrequent
or novice users of the `logging` package can despair of messages written
multiple times to the same or different destinations, to unintended
destinations, not when expected, or even not at all. `logging` is a respectably
powerful and complex package whose basic ways of doing things may not be quickly
apparent. Understanding how `logging` works is essential to getting the most out
it. `prelogging`'s documentation and examples can help clarify much about `logging`
that may seem murky.

Using prelogging
-------------------------

With `prelogging`, you construct a *logging configuration dictionary*, or
*logging config dict*, a dict in the format expected by ``logging.dictConfig()``.

Logging config dicts are represented in `prelogging` by the ``LCDict`` class. You call
the methods of this class on an instance to incrementally build a logging config dict,
adding specifications of formatters, filters (if any), handlers, and loggers other
than the root if you want any. When adding these descriptions of logging entities,
you give them names, and then refer to them by those names in subsequent method calls –
for example, when attaching an already-described formatter to a handler, or attaching
already-described handlers to a logger.

When you've added all the elements you require, a call to the instance's ``config()``
method results in a call to ``logging.dictConfig()``, which configures logging.
At this point, you are most likely done with the ``LCDict`` instance. You access
loggers with the ``logging.getLogger(name)`` function, as usual, using the names
you gave them in the logging config dict.

.. sidebar:: is-a or has-a

    The ``LCDict`` class, which represents logging config dicts, is a subclass of ``dict`` –
    It doesn't *contain* a dict, it *is* one. In ordinary and intended uses, this can be
    considered an implementation detail: the methods of ``"LCDict`` are sufficient to build
    a logging config dict, without any calls to ``dict`` methods. Nevertheless, you really
    *are* building a ``dict``, after all, and it would be premature and presumptuous to
    offer a nanny-API which denies that.

Requirements
---------------

The `prelogging` package requires only Python 3.4+ or 2.7. It has no external
dependencies.

Very little of `prelogging`\'s code is sensitive to Python 3 vs 2.
To address the few remaining differences, we've used `six`, sparingly (one decorator,
one function, and one constant). The `prelogging` package includes a copy of the
``six.py`` module (presently v1.10.0, for what it's worth), so no separate
installation is required.

Installation
---------------

You can install `prelogging` from PyPI (the Python Package Index) using ``pip``::

    $ pip install prelogging

(Here and elsewhere, ``$`` at the beginning of a line indicates your command
prompt, whatever that may be.)

Alternately, you can

* clone the github repo, or
* download a ``.zip`` or ``.tar.gz`` archive of the repository
  from github or PyPI, and uncompress it

to a fresh directory, change to that directory, and run::

    $ python setup.py install

Downloading and uncompressing the archive lets you review, run and/or copy the
tests and examples, which aren't installed by ``pip`` or ``setup.py``. Whichever
method you choose to install `prelogging`, ideally you'll do it in a `virtual
environment <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_.

Tests and Examples
----------------------------

The `prelogging` repository contains the ``tests/`` and ``examples/`` subdirectories.

The tests are as thorough as is reasonable, and achieve from 88% to 100% coverage
depending on the module.

The examples illustrate many basic and advanced uses, including several adaptations
of examples in the `Logging HOWTO <https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html>`_ guide
and `The Logging Cookbook <https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#logging-cookbook>`_.
The `Guide to Examples <https://pythonhosted.org/prelogging/guide-to-examples.html>`_
in the full `prelogging` documentation catalogs all the examples and briefly
describes each one.

The tests and examples together achieve almost complete coverage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quick Start
-------------------

Let's see how to configure logging with `prelogging`. Suppose we want the
following setup:

.. _example-overview-config:

    **Configuration requirements**

    Messages should be logged to both ``stderr`` and a file. Only messages with
    loglevel ``INFO`` or higher should appear on-screen, but all messages should
    be logged to the file. Messages to ``stderr`` should consist of just the
    message, but messages written to the file should also contain the logger
    name and the (name of the) message's loglevel.

    The logfile contents should persist: the file handler should **append**
    to the logfile, rather than overwriting it each time the program using these
    loggers is run.

This suggests two handlers, each with a distinct formatter and loglevel – a ``stderr``
stream handler with level ``INFO``, and a file handler with level ``NOTSET``.
(``NOTSET`` is the default loglevel for handlers. Numerically less than ``DEBUG``,
all loglevels are greater than or equal to it.)
Both handlers should be attached to the root logger, which should have level
``DEBUG`` to allow all messages through. The file handler should be created with
``mode='a'`` (append, not ``'w'`` for overwrite) so that the the logfile
contents can persist.

Using the example configuration
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Once this configuration is established, these logging calls:

.. code::

    import logging
    root_logger = logging.getLogger()
    # ...
    root_logger.debug("1. 0 = 0")
    root_logger.info("2. Couldn't create new Foo object")
    root_logger.debug("3. 0 != 1")
    root_logger.warning("4. Foo factory raised IndexError")

should produce the following ``stderr`` output – the messages with loglevel ``INFO``
or greater, with the simplest formatting:

.. code::

    2. Couldn't create new Foo object
    4. Foo factory raised IndexError

and the logfile should contain (something much like) these lines:

.. code::

    root                : DEBUG   : 1. 0 = 0
    root                : INFO    : 2. Couldn't create new Foo object
    root                : DEBUG   : 3. 0 != 1
    root                : WARNING : 4. Foo factory raised IndexError

Creating the example configuration
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Here's a first pass at using an ``LCDict`` to configure logging as required.
After walking through this, we'll look at a more concise version which takes
advantage of various conveniences offerred by ``LCDict``::

    from prelogging import LCDict

    lcd = LCDict(root_level='DEBUG')
    lcd.add_formatter('con', format='%(message)s')
    lcd.add_formatter('file', format='%(name)15s: %(levelname)8s: %(message)s')
    lcd.add_stderr_handler(
                    'h_stderr',
                    formatter='con',
                    level='INFO')
    lcd.add_file_handler('h_file',
                         formatter='file',
                         filename='blather.log')
    lcd.attach_root_handlers('h_stderr', 'h_file')  # attach handlers to root
    lcd.config()

This should remind you of how logging can be set up using the `logging` API.
However, each ``LCDict`` method accomplishes more, on average, than the `logging` functions
and methods you'd use to set this up. Here, we're building a dictionary; the actual formatter
and handlers aren't created until the final ``lcd.config()`` call.

First we create an ``LCDict``, which we call ``lcd`` — a logging config dict
with root loglevel ``'DEBUG'`` (the default root loglevel is ``'WARNING'``).
We add to it a couple of (descriptions of) formatters that the handlers will use.
Next, we add the handlers: first, one named 'h_stderr' which writes to ``stderr``,
uses the simpler format we named ``'con'``, and has loglevel ``'INFO'``; next,
a file handler 'h_file', which writes to a file ``'blather.log'`` (in the current
directory). ``add_file_handler`` takes a ``mode`` keyword parameter, which we
didn't have to specify, as its default value is ``'a'``.
The last configuration step attaches the two handlers to the root logger.
Finally we configure logging by calling ``config()`` on ``lcd``.

**Note**: In `prelogging`, loglevels are always identified by their names
rather than their numeric values – thus, ``'DEBUG'`` not ``logging.DEBUG``, and so on.

Creating the example configuration more concisely
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We can simplify this example further::

    from prelogging import LCDict

    lcd = LCDict(root_level='DEBUG',
                 attach_handlers_to_root=True
    ).add_stderr_handler(
                    'h_stderr',
                    formatter='msg',
                    level='INFO'
    ).add_file_handler(
                    'h_file',
                    formatter='logger_level_msg',
                    filename='blather.log')
    lcd.config()



Here, most of the method calls are chained.
The methods of ``LCDict`` (and its superclass ``LCDictBasic``) generally return
``self``, which makes chaining possible.

Because handlers are so commonly attached to the root logger,
``LCDict`` makes it easy to do that.
In this shorter version, ``lcd`` is initialized with ``attach_handlers_to_root=True``.
As a result, the (specifications of the) two handlers are attached to the root
as soon as they're added to ``lcd``; it's no longer necessary to call
``lcd.add_root_handlers('h_stderr', 'h_file')``.
(``attach_handlers_to_root`` establishes a default for an ``LCDict``, which can
be overridden in any ``add_*_handler`` call with the keyword argument ``attach_to_root``.)

No formatters are explicitly created, yet the handlers reference formatters
named ``'msg'`` and ``'logger_level_msg'``. These are a couple of the `formatter
presets` supplied by `prelogging`.


Adding additional loggers that use the existing handlers
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Suppose you later add to your project a module ``new_module.py``, which will also
use logging, via its own logger ``'new_module'``. If it meets your needs for this
logger to use the existing handlers, then you can just use this logger,
no extra configuration required!

For example::

    # new_module.py
    import logging

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)    # __name__ == 'new_module'
    # ...
    logger.debug("It's 11:11 pm")
    logger.error("UH OH!")
    # ...

This writes the error message to ``stderr``::

    UH OH!!!!

and also appends both messages to the file, together with the logger name and level::

    new_module          : DEBUG   : It's 11:11 pm
    new_module          : ERROR   : UH OH!!!!

Why this works: ancestors and propagation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. sidebar:: Ancestors and names

    The ancestor relation among loggers is, by default, the simple relation
    between their dotted names: L1 is an ancestor of L2 *iff* the name of L1 is a prefix
    of the name of L2, and no part between dots is split. The parent of a logger
    is its nearest ancestor. The root, whose name is ``''``, is an ancestor of every logger,
    and the parent of some. For example, a logger ``'foo'`` is ancestor of ``'foo.bar'``
    and ``'foo.bar.baz'``, but not of ``'foolserrand'``; ``'foo.bar'`` is an ancestor
    (the parent) of ``'foo.bar.baz'``, but not of ``'foo.bargeld'`` nor of
    ``'foo.bartend.sunday'``. Of the loggers just mentioned, only ``'foo'``
    has the root logger as parent.


A call to ``logging.getLogger`` creates the requested logger just in time, if it
doesn't already exist; all subsequent requests to get the logger of the same name
will return the same ``Logger`` object. Here, the name of the logger requested is
``'new_module'``, the value of ``__name__`` in this module. Like any newly created logger,
it has no handlers, its loglevel is ``'NOTSET'``, and logged messages *propagate*
to the handlers of its *ancestors* (``logger.propagate`` is ``True``).
The name of the root logger is simply ``''`` (empty string),
and it is the only ancestor of ``logger``. Thus, without any extra work,
all messages logged by ``logger`` will be sent directly to the root's handlers.

If we attached a third handler to this logger (during configuration, or afterward
configuration, using the `logging` API), and if we left the logger's ``propagate``
flag set to True, then messages written by this logger would be sent to that handler
*as well as* to the two attached to the root.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


.. _supported-handlers:

Handler classes encapsulated by ``LCDict``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `logging` package defines more than a dozen handler classes — subclasses of
``logging.Handler`` — in the modules ``logging`` and ``logging.handlers``.
``logging`` defines the basic stream, file and null handler classes, for which
``LCDictBasic`` supplies  ``add_*_handler`` methods. ``logging.handlers`` defines
more specialized handler classes, for about half of which (presently) ``LCDict``
provides corresponding ``add_*_handler`` methods.

.. index:: `'logging` handler classes encapsulated

.. _LCDict-handler-classes-encapsulated:

Handler classes that LCDict configures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

LCDict provides methods for configuring these `logging` handler classes, with
optional multiprocessing-aware "locking" support in most cases:

  +--------------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+
  || method                        || creates                  || optional |

  +--------------------------------+---------------------------+-----------+

.. _auto-attach-handlers-to-root:

.. _easy-mp-safe-logging:

Easy multiprocessing-safe logging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As shown in the table above, `prelogging` provides multiprocessing-safe ("locking")
versions of the essential handler classes that write to the console, streams, files,
rotating files, and syslog.

.. _easy-filter-creation:
.. _filters:

Simplified creation and use of filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Filter allow finer control than mere loglevel comparison over which messages
actually get logged. In conjunction with formatters, they can also be used
to add additional data fields to messages.

There are two kinds of filters: class filters and callable filters.
``LCDict`` provides a pair of convenience methods, ``add_class_filter`` and
``add_callable_filter``, which are much easier to use than the lower-level
``LCDictBasic`` method ``add_filter``.

In Python 2, the `logging` module imposes a fussy requirement on callables
that can be used as filters, which the Python 3 implementation of `logging`
removes. The ``add_callable_filter`` method provides a single, sane interface
for adding callable filters that works in both Python versions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _config-abc:

Using ``LCDictBuilderABC``
-------------------------------

One way for a larger program to configure logging is to pass around an
``LCDict`` to the different "areas" of the program, each area contributing
specifications of its desired formatters, filters, handlers and loggers.
(Just what the "areas" of a program are, is in the eye of the developer. They
might be all the modules, or only certain major ones.)
The ``LCDictBuilderABC`` class provides a mini-microframework that automates
this approach: each area of a program only has to define an ``LCDictBuilderABC``
subclass and override its method ``add_to_lcdict(lcd)``, where it contributes
its specifications by calling methods on ``lcd``.
