An example that illustrates how to use a QueueListener with `prelogging` so that
messages can be logged on a separate thread. In this way, handlers that block
and take long to complete (e.g. SMTP handlers, which send emails) won't make
other threads (e.g. the UI thread) stall and stutter.

For motivation, see

    `Dealing with handlers that block
    <https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#dealing-with-handlers-that-block>`_

We've adapted the code in that section to `prelogging`.

Another approach can be found in the example
``mproc_approach__queue_handler_logging_thread.py``.
